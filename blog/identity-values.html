      <h2>An ethical decision</h2>
      <p>
        Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that
        decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
      </p>
      <h2>My culture</h2>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in NZ. My mother is of Rarotongan decent and my father is Pakeha. Growing up as a 'half cast' has at some
        stages created feelings of not knowing where I belong culturally. This has highly influenced my love of knowing more about and
        experiencing other cultures. I think
      </p>
      <p>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</p>
      <h2>My career related strengths & limitations</h2>
      <p>
        One of my biggest strengths in relation to learning is my ability to set goals and stick at them until I achieve them. This is
        also the same with understanding hard concepts. I feel that this is one of the most important skills to have as a software
        developer as I believe the only thing that sets people who achieve great things apart from people who do not achieve great
        things is the time spent to achieve that thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        A limitation I have can often be my ability to communicate my emotions effectively with others. I feel this is an important
        skill to master especially when working in a team environment.
      </p>
      <h2>Collaborative strategies</h2>
      <p>
        Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or
        tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies
        you would try now, and why.
