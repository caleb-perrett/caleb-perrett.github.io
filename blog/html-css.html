      <p>
        An important concept to understand first is that every single element on a web page is a block. Literally a rectangle of
        pixels.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the &lt;div&gt; element is a block rectangle that by default takes up the entire width of the page and the
        &lt;span&gt; element is block that takes up the minimal width of the page. Now that you are picturing every single page element
        as a block of pixels, we can talk about how positioning is used to get the blocks of pixels exactly where you want them to go.
      </p>
      <img class="position-values-image" src="/images/position-values-list.PNG" alt="A picture of the list of position Values" />
      <h2>Static</h2>
      <p>
        This is the default for every single page element. Different elements don’t have different default values for positioning, they
        all start out as static. Static doesn’t mean much; it just means that the element will flow into the page as it normally would.
        The only reason you would ever set an element to position: static; is to forcefully remove some positioning that got applied to
        an element outside of your control. This is fairly rare, as positioning doesn’t cascade.
      </p>
      <h2>Relative</h2>
      <p>
        This type of positioning is probably the most confusing and misused. What it really means is “relative to itself”. If you set
        position: relative; on an element but no other positioning attributes (top, left, bottom or right), it will have no effect on
        it’s positioning at all, it will be exactly as it would be if you left it as position: static; But if you do give it some other
        positioning attribute, say, top: 10px;, it will shift its position 10 pixels down from where it would normally be. I’m sure you
        can imagine, the ability to shift an element around based on its regular position is pretty useful. I find myself using this to
        line up form elements many times that have a tendency to not want to line up how I want them to.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two other things that happen when you set position: relative; on an element that you should be aware of. One is that
        it introduces the ability to use z-index on that element, which doesn’t work with statically positioned elements. Even if you
        don’t set a z-index value, this element will now appear on top of any other statically positioned element. You can’t fight it
        by setting a higher z-index value on a statically positioned element.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other thing that happens is it limits the scope of absolutely positioned child elements. Any element that is a child of the
        relatively positioned element can be absolutely positioned within that block.
      </p>
      <h2>Absolute</h2>
      <p>
        This is a very powerful type of positioning that allows you to literally place any page element exactly where you want it. You
        use the positioning attributes top, left, bottom, and right to set the location. Remember that these values will be relative to
        the next parent element with relative (or absolute) positioning. If there is no such parent, it will default all the way back
        up to the &lt;html&gt; element itself meaning it will be placed relative to the page itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trade-off (and most important thing to remember) about absolute positioning is that these elements are removed from the
        flow of elements on the page. An element with this type of positioning is not affected by other elements and it doesn’t affect
        other elements. This is a serious thing to consider every time you use absolute positioning. Its overuse or improper use can
        limit the flexibility of your site.
      </p>
      <h2>Fixed</h2>
      <p>
        A fixed position element is positioned relative to the viewport, or the browser window itself. The viewport doesn’t change when
        the window is scrolled, so a fixed positioned element will stay right where it is when the page is scrolled.
      </p>
      <p>
        This might be used for something like a navigation bar that you want to remain visible at all times regardless of the pages
        scroll position. The concern with fixed positioning is that it can cause situations where the fixed element overlaps content
        such that is is inaccessible. The trick is having enough space to avoid that.
      </p>
      <h2>Sticky</h2>
      <p>
        Sticky positioning is really unique! A sticky element will just sit there like a static element, but as you scroll past it, if
        it’s parent element has room (usually: extra height) the sticky element will behave as if it’s fixed until that parent element
        is out of room.
