      <h2>My long term goal and career pathway</h2>
      <p>
        My long term goal as a software developer is to create or be a part of a team to create a piece of software that will be used
        by millions. When I finish this course I will become a junior developer in my company and will begin work as a developer on our
        current projects within my company, also while retaining my role as a product owner.
      </p>
      <h2>My strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h2>
      <p>
        One of my biggest strengths in relation to learning is my ability to set goals and stick at them until I achieve them. This is
        also the same with understanding hard concepts. I feel that this is one of the most important skills to have as a software
        developer as I believe the only thing that sets people who achieve great things apart from people who do not achieve great
        things is the time spent to achieve that thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        A limitation I have can often be my ability to communicate my emotions effectively with others. I feel this is an important
        skill to master especially when working in a team environment.
      </p>
      <h2>Skills I would like to see developed while at EDA</h2>
      <p>
        The one and only reason why I'm studying at EDA is to improve my technical understanding of software development, and to do
        that as fast as possible. A huge part of this technical understand is developing a strong knowledge of Javascript.
      </p>
      <h2>How I will manage the workload while at EDA</h2>
      <p>I will manage my workload by getting it done.</p>
      <p>
        Taking regular breaks from work is something I'm finding is key to understanding things. Having other hobbies is also very
        important to have a good work life balance. I enjoy getting into nature, boxing and working out. These are things that I
        prioritize.
      </p>
      <h2>How and where I will seek help in a timely way</h2>
      <p>I will seek help when needed.</p>
      <h2>What I expect from the facilitation team</h2>
      <p>I expect the facilitation team to provide help and resource when needed but to also allow for self directed learning.</p>
