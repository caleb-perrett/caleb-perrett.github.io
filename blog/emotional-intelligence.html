      <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence can be defined as; the ability to recognize, understand and manage our own emotions and the ability to
        recognize, understand and influence the emotions of others. In practical terms, this means being aware that emotions can drive
        our behavior and impact people (positively and negatively), and learning how to manage those emotions – both our own and
        others.
      </p>
      <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
      <p>
        Managing emotions is especially important in situations when we are under pressure. For example, when we are giving and
        receiving feedback, meeting tight deadlines, dealing with challenging relationships, not having enough resources, navigating
        change and working through setbacks and failure.
      </p>
      <p>
        When emotions run high, they change the way our brains function, diminishing our cognitive abilities, decision-making powers,
        and even interpersonal skills. At a personal level, emotional intelligence can help us have uncomfortable conversations without
        hurting feelings, manage our emotions when stressed or feeling overwhelmed and improve relationships with the people we care
        about. At work, emotional intelligence can help us resolve conflicts, coach and motivate others, create a culture of
        collaboration and build psychological safety within teams.
      </p>
      <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
      <p>
        According to research conducted at the Harvard school of business it was found that EQ counts for twice as much as IQ and
        technical skills combined in determining who will be successful in the work place.
      </p>
      <p>
        IQ, which stands for intelligence quotient, is a measure of someone’s reasoning ability. IQ is actually a number that is
        supposed to indicate how well someone can use information and logic to solve problems. That number is a measure of both
        crystallized intelligence and fluid intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crystallized intelligence is the knowledge and skills we acquire throughout life, while fluid intelligence is a person’s
        ability to reason, solve problems, and understand abstract information. The former is directly associated with learning and
        experience and increases as we grow older. However, the latter, i.e., fluid intelligence, is not dependent on learning and
        tends to decline as we grow older. However, it’s also important to notice that since intelligence is an abstract concept, it’s
        not possible to achieve a concrete measure of intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main difference between IQ and EQ is that IQ is a measure of someone’s reasoning ability, while EQ is the ability to
        perceive, evaluate and control emotions.
